    <title>Performance of BuildingOccupancyMonitoring App</title>
    <purpose><![CDATA[
      Check performance of the BuildingOccupancyMonitoring app.

      The BuildingOccupancyMonitoring app is a combination of three EPL apps to monitor occupancies 
      of buildings. It combines BuildingOccupancyCalculation, AlarmOnMeasurementThreshold, and 
      OperationOnAlarmNotCleared EPL apps.

      Each building has multiple access points through which people can enter or exit. Each access point 
      generates measurements for the total number of people entered and exited through it. The 
      BuildingOccupancyCalculation app calculates the total occupancy of each building and generates 
      periodic measurements with the count. The AlarmOnMeasurementThreshold is used to monitor the total occupancy 
      of each building and raises an alarm if occupancy is more than the defined threshold. The OperationOnAlarmNotCleared 
      app monitors the raised alarms and creates an operation if a raised alarm is not cleared within the configured duration.
